### User Story

Use this template as a baseline for creating a user story. A good user story describe what a user may need for a feature and provides brief context into why. The requirements are written in a if given then when. 

All User Stories should include the following:

* Concise requirements
* Written as if a user were requesting it
* Provide a value statement
* Describe a single feature set
* Acceptance criteria for MVP
* Confirmation criteria

As a guideline, the __[3 C's](/glossary/#3-cs)__ of User Stories is a baseline for the following template.
